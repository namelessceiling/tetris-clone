# tetris-clone

Tetris is originally a game released in 1984.

Pieces made of 4 blocks are called tetrominoes, there are 7 different shapes in the game.

They fall down the well and players can rotate them until they hit another tetromino or the bottom of the well.

If there is an entire row of tetrominoes touching each other, that row disappears awarding the player with points. Chaining multiple rows to have tetrominoes touch each other will result in more points.

The game continues until no more tetrominoes can fall
